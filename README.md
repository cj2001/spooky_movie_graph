# spooky_movie_graph

This repository is in support of the Kaggle Spooky Movie challenge.  The goal of this challenge is to try and predict whether a movie is spooky or not based on a variety of graph features within Neo4j.  There are queries shown here for how to query Wikidata RDF's to assemble the graph using [Neosematics](https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/).
